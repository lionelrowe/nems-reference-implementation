        <h1 class="h2">Welcome to the NEMS Demonstrator App</h1>

        <p>The aim of this app is to demonstrate what event messages look like, what subscriptions look like and how messages flow.</p>

        <p>The NEMS stub that is utilised here has been developed against v2.0.1-beta of the <a href="https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/ems-beta/index.html" target="_blank">NEMS Specification</a>.</p>

        <p>There is also a built in MESH stub that helps to demonstrate message flows from Publishers to NEMS and then from NEMS onto Subscribers. Select from below to get started.</p>
